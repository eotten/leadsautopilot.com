  <h1>LeadsAutopilot Terms of Service</h1>
  <h2>Brookstone Digital Services LLC</h2>

  <h3>1. Service Nature</h3>
  <p>
    LeadsAutopilot is a software platform provided by Brookstone Digital Services LLC. It is not a managed service (“Done for you”). You are responsible for configuring and operating the software. LeadsAutopilot does not guarantee any particular monetary results or business outcomes.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Uptime and Feature Availability</h3>
  <p>
    While we strive for high availability, you understand that downtime or interruptions of specific features may occur, especially due to changes in the LinkedIn algorithm or platform. LeadsAutopilot is not responsible for any such interruptions or resulting impacts.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Free Trials and Billing</h3>
  <p>
    We may, at our discretion, offer a free trial period. By using a free trial, you acknowledge and agree that we may bill you according to our standard pricing once the trial period ends, unless you cancel your membership before the trial concludes.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Memberships and Refunds</h3>
  <p>
    We offer a 48-hour money-back guarantee on all new membership purchases. To request a refund, you must email support@leadsautopilot.com within 48 hours of your purchase date. Upon refund approval, your service access will be immediately revoked. Only one refund per customer is permitted. We reserve the right to deny refunds to customers we suspect are attempting to circumvent this one-refund limit. After 48 hours, all membership purchases are nonrefundable due to the digital nature of our services.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Account Deletion and Membership Cancellation</h3>
  <p>
    You may delete your account and cancel your membership at any time by navigating to the “Membership” tab at <a href="https://app.leadsautopilot.com" target="_blank">app.leadsautopilot.com</a>. You are responsible for completing all required steps to cancel your membership. Cancellation is only effective once all steps are completed.
