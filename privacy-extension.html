        <div class="section-title">1. Introduction</div>
        <p>Brookstone Digital Services LLC ("Company," or "we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy, and we are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use our LeadsAutopilot Connect Chrome Extension (our "Extension") and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> The LeadsAutopilot Connect Chrome Extension is designed with your privacy in mind. No data is automatically sent to any third party. This extension simply displays the values of one of the cookies for you to copy and paste to securely connect your LinkedIn account to LeadsAutopilot servers.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Extension. By using our Extension, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <div class="section-title">2. Children Under the Age of 16</div>
        <p>Our Extension is not intended for children under 16 years of age. No one under age 16 may provide any information through the Extension. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 16. If you are under 16, do not use or provide any information through our Extension.

        <div class="section-title">3. Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It</div>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Cookie Access:</strong> Our Extension is designed to access and display specific cookie values from LinkedIn to enable you to securely connect your LinkedIn account to our services. These cookie values are <strong>only displayed to you</strong> and are not automatically transmitted to our servers or any third parties. You must manually copy and paste this information to connect your account.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>No Automatic Data Collection</h3>
        <p>The Extension does not automatically collect or transmit any data. It simply helps you identify and copy certain cookie values that you can then choose to provide to our service to enable account connectivity features.</p>

        <h3>Information You Choose to Provide</h3>
        <p>When you choose to connect your LinkedIn account to LeadsAutopilot, you manually copy and paste cookie information displayed by the Extension. This connection allows our server to temporarily access your LinkedIn account to provide the services you've enabled. All connections to our secure server are made over military-grade encryption, and we abide by all data compliance standards.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">4. How We Use Your Information</div>

        <ul>
            <li>To authenticate and establish a secure connection between your LinkedIn account and LeadsAutopilot services;</li>
            <li>To provide the specific LinkedIn-related services you have enabled within your LeadsAutopilot account;</li>
            <li>To fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it and that you have explicitly enabled through our dashboard.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>User Control:</strong> You may enable or disable individual services, or disconnect your account entirely at any time via our dashboard, which is separate from the Extension. When you disconnect your account, all cookie information and LinkedIn connection permissions are revoked.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">5. Disclosure of Your Information</div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">6. Data Security</div>
        <p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All connections to our servers are protected with military-grade encryption;</li>
